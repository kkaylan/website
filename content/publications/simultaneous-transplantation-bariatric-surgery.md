Patients with obesity have limited access to kidney transplantation, mainly due to an increased incidence of surgical complications, which could be reduced with selective use of robotic‐assisted surgery. This prospective randomized controlled trial compares the safety and efficacy of combining robotic sleeve gastrectomy and robotic‐assisted kidney transplant to robotic kidney transplant alone in candidates with class II or III obesity. Twenty candidates were recruited, 11 were randomized to the robotic sleeve gastrectomy and robotic‐assisted kidney transplant group and 9 to the robotic kidney transplant group. At 12‐month follow‐up, change in body mass index was –8.76 ± 1.82 in the robotic sleeve gastrectomy and robotic‐assisted kidney transplant group compared to 1.70 ± 2.30 in the robotic kidney transplant group (P = .0041). Estimated glomerular filtration rate, serum creatinine, readmission rates, and graft failure rates up to 12 months were not different between the two groups. Length of surgery was longer in the robotic sleeve gastrectomy and robotic‐assisted kidney transplant group (405 minutes vs. 269 minutes, p = .00304) without increase in estimated blood loss (120 ml vs. 117 ml, p = .908) or incidence of surgical complications. Combined robotic‐assisted kidney transplant and sleeve gastrectomy is safe and effective compared to robotic‐assisted kidney transplant alone.

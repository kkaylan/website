Hepatic tissue engineering aims to develop novel therapeutic approaches for liver disease and promote an improved understanding of fundamental characteristics of liver biology. This chapter will review current approaches in hepatic tissue engineering that utilize hydrogels, ranging from in vitro model systems to bioartificial livers (BAL) devices and implantable tissue constructs. Reproducing the full complexity of liver architecture and dynamics remains a key barrier to the long-term stabilization and control of hepatic cultures and the development of next-generation therapies for liver failure. Hydrogels provide a valuable means for overcoming these barriers by enabling the systematic analysis and control of hepatocellular environments.

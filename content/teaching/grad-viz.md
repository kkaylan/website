This graduate-level short course is a hands-on introduction to data visualization. It is aimed at graduate students in the Sociology department. We focus on the practical analysis and presentation of real data, while also covering some material on the aesthetic and especially the cognitive aspects of graphical perception and interpretation. The goals are (1) to develop a good working sense of why some graphs and figures work well while others either fail to inform or actively mislead, and (2) to provide a solid grounding in how to produce good data visualizations in R.

Stephen Heard [on post-publication peer review](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2015/12/14/post-publication-peer-review-and-the-problem-of-privilege/):

> This seems to me a huge irony about proposals to replace pre-publication with post-publication peer review. At first glance, such proposals seem like the ultimate democratization: everyone’s manuscript on an equal footing. My manuscript and yours, a Nobel prize-winner’s and the rankest amateur’s, all available for readers whose comments will bubble the very best to the top. But this democratization will, I worry, turn out to be self-disrupting. Its very existence (coupled with the enormity of our literature) seems to force us to use prioritization signals that restore the very privilege we thought we were stamping out.

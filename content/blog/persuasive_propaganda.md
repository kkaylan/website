GraphPadâ€™s advice regarding [when to plot SD versus SEM](http://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/6/statistics/index.htm?statwhentoplotsdvssem.htm):

> If you want to create persuasive propaganda:
> If your goal is to emphasize small and unimportant differences in your data, show your error bars as SEM, and hope that your readers think they are SD.
> If your goal is to cover-up large differences, show the error bars as the standard deviations for the groups, and hope that your readers think they are a standard errors.

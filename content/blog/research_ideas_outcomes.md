Another new journal that, like *Matters*, launched earlier this year: [*Research Ideas and Outcomes*](http://riojournal.com/) or *RIO*.

From their front page:

> The *Research Ideas and Outcomes* (*RIO*) journal publishes all outputs of the research cycle, including: project proposals, data, methods, workflows, software, project reports and research articles together on a single collaborative platform, with the most transparent, open and public peer-review process. Our scope encompasses all areas of academic research, including science, technology, humanities and the social sciences.

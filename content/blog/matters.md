There’s a new open access journal in town: [*Matters*](https://www.sciencematters.io/). Their tagline: “Stories can wait. Science can’t.” *Science* magazine has an article delving into the motivation for its creation. According to that article, “[*Matters*] aims to create a freely accessible venue for single findings, even confirmatory data and contradictory data.”

I’m ambivalent. A lot of data falls through the cracks or are otherwise not part of a coherent, compelling, or “impactful” story. *Matters* provides an important means to quickly publish and archive this data.

Yet I cannot keep up with the coherent stories published in my field as it is. How will I be able to keep up with the “single observations” that will, doubtless, flow from *Matters*?

And the broader question of researcher incentive remains. The simultaneous, and somewhat dissonant, pressure to publish either eye-catching stories in high-impact journals or prolifically in middle-tier journals—the “minimum publishable unit” comes to mind—remain.

I am a fellow in the [Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism](https://medicine.uchicago.edu/sections/endocrinology-diabetes-metabolism/) and [Physician Scientist Development Program](https://imr.bsd.uchicago.edu/physician-scientist-development-program-psdp/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu). My undergraduate studies were in biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan, where my work in Dr. Shuichi Takayama’s lab exposed me to the use of microtechnologies for both biological inquiry and the improvement of human health. I went on to complete my M.D./Ph.D. as part of the Medical Scholars Program at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.

My doctoral research was in the lab of [Dr. Gregory Underhill](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/directory/profile/gunderhi) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. I focused on the development of the liver, specifically elucidating the microenvironmental cues which guide differentiation of liver progenitor cells toward hepatocytic or cholangiocytic fates. To better understand these developmental processes, I established an advanced cell microarray platform capable of both combinatorial presentation of microenvironmental cues and simultaneous readout of biochemical and biomechanical cell states. I used this platform productively toward the study of cellular fate and function in liver development, lung adenocarcinoma, and endothelial dysregulation.

Outside of research, I have been involved in committees focused on teaching and service activities. I particularly enjoy teaching and have led courses in histology and clinical skills as well as summer camps for high school students and undergraduate courses in bioengineering. I also served as chair of the Special Projects Team of the Student Curricular Board at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, implementing a lean startup approach to identify curricular issues and generate solutions through collaborative efforts between students and faculty.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing viola, programming, strength training, and tennis.

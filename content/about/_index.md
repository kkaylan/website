I am an MD/PhD student at the [University of Illinois College of Medicine](http://medicine.uic.edu/). My doctoral work in the [Tissue Development and Engineering Laboratory](http://underhill.bioen.illinois.edu/) with [Professor Gregory Underhill](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/directory/profile/gunderhi) was focused on tissue engineering methods—chiefly cellular microarrays—to study biological processes related to stem and progenitor cell fate. I extensively utilize [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), [CellProfiler](http://cellprofiler.org/), [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and related software packages to analyze, interpret, and present my data and am actively interested in new computational methods for understanding and visualizing biology.

Outside of school and lab, I enjoy reading, playing viola, tinkering with computers and programming, strength training, and tennis.

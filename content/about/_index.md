I am an MD/PhD student at the [University of Illinois College of Medicine](http://medicine.uic.edu/). My doctoral research in the lab of [Professor Gregory Underhill](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/directory/profile/gunderhi) at the University of Illinois at Urbanaâ€“Champaign was focused on the development of the liver, specifically using tissue engineering approaches to elucidate the microenvironmental cues which guide differentiation of liver progenitor cells toward hepatocytic or cholangiocytic fates. Outside of research, I have been involved in committees focused on teaching and service activities. I particularly enjoy teaching and have led courses in histology and clinical skills within the College of Medicine as well as summer camps for high school students and undergraduate courses in bioengineering.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing viola, programming, strength training, and tennis.

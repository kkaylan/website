I am an M.D./Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois College of Medicine](http://medicine.uic.edu/) in Chicago. I completed my undergraduate degree in biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan, where my work in Dr. Shuichi Takayama’s lab exposed me to the use of microtechnologies for both biological inquiry and the improvement of human health. I chose to pursue M.D./Ph.D. training to combine my interests in both bioengineering and medicine.

My doctoral research was in the lab of [Dr. Gregory Underhill](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/directory/profile/gunderhi) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. My research with Dr. Underhill was focused on the development of the liver, specifically elucidating the microenvironmental cues which guide differentiation of liver progenitor cells toward hepatocytic or cholangiocytic fates. To better understand these developmental processes, I established an advanced cell microarray platform capable of both combinatorial presentation of microenvironmental cues and simultaneous readout of biochemical and biomechanical cell states. I used this platform productively toward the study of cellular fate and function in liver development, lung adenocarcinoma, and endothelial dysregulation.

Outside of research, I have been involved in committees focused on teaching and service activities. I particularly enjoy teaching and have led courses in histology and clinical skills as well as summer camps for high school students and undergraduate courses in bioengineering. I also served as chair of the Special Projects Team of the Student Curricular Board at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, implementing a lean start-up approach to identify curricular issues and generate solutions through collaborative efforts between students and faculty.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing viola, programming, strength training, and tennis.

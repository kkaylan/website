        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am an adult endocrinology fellow in the Section of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism and Physician Scientist Development Program at the University of Chicago. My undergraduate studies were in biomedical engineering at the University of Michigan, where my work in Dr. Shuichi Takayama's lab exposed me to the use of microtechnologies for both biological inquiry and the improvement of human health. I went on to complete my M.D./Ph.D. as part of the Medical Scholars Program at the University of Illinois College of Medicine.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>My doctoral research was in the lab of Dr. Gregory Underhill at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I focused on the development of the liver, specifically elucidating the microenvironmental cues which guide differentiation of liver progenitor cells toward hepatocytic or cholangiocytic fates. To better understand these developmental processes, I established an advanced cell microarray platform capable of both combinatorial presentation of microenvironmental cues and simultaneous readout of biochemical and biomechanical cell states. I used this platform toward the study of cellular fate and function in liver development as well as collaborative efforts in lung adenocarcinoma and endothelial dysregulation.</p>

        <p>During fellowship, I joined Dr. Raghu Mirmira's laboratory at the University of Chicago. The Mirmira laboratory investigates the role of &beta; cells in the early pathogenesis of diabetes. My initial projects in the Mirmira laboratory have involved humanized mouse models to study inhibition of 12-lipoxygenase, one pathway which is known to contribute to &beta; cell stress.</p>

        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>Outside of research, I have been involved in committees focused on teaching and service activities. I particularly enjoy teaching and have led courses in histology and clinical skills as well as summer camps for high school students and undergraduate courses in bioengineering. I also served as chair of the Special Projects Team of the Student Curricular Board at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, implementing a lean startup approach to identify curricular issues and generate solutions through collaborative efforts between students and faculty.</p>
